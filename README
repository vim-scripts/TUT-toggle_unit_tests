Usage:

Use this plug-in when you are doing Test-Driven Development [TDD] in any
language to quickly switch between unit-test and production code. To make this
really fast bind the Toggle function to a function key in your .vimrc:

    "   [F3]    toggles between (header, ) source and test files.
    nnoremap    <F3> :<C-U>TUT<CR>

This plug-in assumes source and unit test files are in the same directory.

Commands:

:TUT
    Toggles betwixt source and unit test file

Mappings:

<Leader>tut
    Calls :TUT

Settings:

By default, unit-test filenames are deemed to begin with 't_'.

Tell toggle_unit_tests.vim your own prefix by setting the following global
variable, perhaps in your .vimrc:

    let g:unit_test_prefix='test_'
